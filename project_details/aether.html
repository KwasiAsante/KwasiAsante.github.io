    <p>Cadescent Aether is a colourful rock-paper-scissors 2-player game where a player takes on waves of enemies
      using energetic rhythm mechanics that give the game a mix of challenge and strategy. Each player must navigate
      between the three lanes and
      send out a pair of three shapes to do battle against their foe. Both players have a choice of three
      shapes: a sphere, a cube, or a triangular-prism with each shape able to defeat one of the others. The goal of the
      game is to get as many shapes as possible into your opponent's side within the time limit.</p>
    <p>Cadescent Aether was made during the 2017 Global Game Jam. I worked alongside 3
      other programmers and took on the role of the game mechanics developer. I created and polished the
      rock-paper-scissors mechanics and player controls. I also fine-tuned the rules and lane
      movement mechanics. As well, I assisted my other team members with work on the menu screen UI and
      with general debugging.</p>
