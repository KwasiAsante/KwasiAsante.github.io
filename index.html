                        <p>Hi! My name is Kwasi Asante I am an aspiring game developer currently studying Game Programming at Humber College in Toronto.
                        <p>My passion for programming (and computers in general) started at a very young age due to both of my parents own involvment in the field.
                        <p>Through my studies and personal projects, I hold a good understanding of programming in C#, C++, Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                        <p>I studied Game Programming at Humber College in Toronto, where I had the opportunity to expand both my experience and my knowledge of best practices in these languages through the development of many types of video games.
                        <p>To that end, I also participate in "Game Jams" to increase my abilities to work with a team and absorb lessons and experience that were previously unknown to me.
                        <p>Currently, I am taking more leadership roles by being the Lead Programmer in my current project. Below I have included links to my projects, my resume, and some links to contact me.
                        <p>Take a look around and feel free to reach out to me to discuss any of my projects.

                                    <p>Cadescent Aether is a colorful rock-paper-scissors wave 2-player game with energetic rhythme mechanics to give the game a mix of challenge and strategy. Each player must navigate between the three lanes and send out a pair of of three shapes to send out against their foe. Both players have a choice of three shapes; shpere, cube, and triangluar-prism with each shape able defeat the other. The goal of the game is to get as many shapes into your opponsite's side within the time limit.</p>
                                    <p>Cadescent Aether was made during the 2017 Global Game Jam from January 20-22. I worked along side 3 other programmers and took the role as the mechanics developer. I created and polished the rokc-paper-scissors mechanics and player controls. I also ironed out and fine tuned the rules and lane movement mechanics. I also assisted my other team memebers in endvaours such as menu ui and debugging.</p>

Each player controls a tuber, each repsresenting a political leader, and try to jump on to the on coming platforms; the surviving tuber is declared the winner.
