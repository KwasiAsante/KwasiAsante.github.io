          <p>Hi! My name is Kwasi Asante, I am a software developer and game programmer from Brampton.</p>
          <p>My passion for programming (and computers in general) started at a very young age,
            playing around on my family's Windows 95 box and creating spritesheets and mods for PC games.</p>
          <p>Through my studies and personal projects, I hold a good understanding of programming in <strong>C#, C++,
              Java, HTML, CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
            During school, I had the opportunity to expand my knowledge of best practices in these languages through the
            development of mobile, web, and desktop video games.</p>
          <p>Currently, I work at <a class="link" href="https://www.visualtouchpos.com/" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer">Visual Touch POS</a> where I write and maintain <strong>RESTful APIs</strong> using
            <strong>ASP.NET</strong>, develop customer-facing websites with <strong>Windows.WebForms</strong>, and build
            <strong>iOS</strong> and <strong>Android</strong> apps with <strong>Xamarin</strong>.</p>
          <p>I also enjoy participating in Game Jams; they're a great opportunity to collaborate, work under tight
            deadlines and meet new people.
          <p>I previously worked at an indie game studio, <a class="link"
              href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/agile-sloth-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Agile
              Sloth</a>, where I had the opportunity to work on awesome <strong>AR (Augmented Reality) mobile
              games</strong>.</p>
          <p>Below I have included links to my projects, my resume, and some links to contact me.
            Take a look around and feel free to reach out to me to discuss any of my projects.</p>

                <p>Cadescent Aether is a colourful rock-paper-scissors 2-player game where a player takes on waves of
                  enemies
                  using energetic rhythm mechanics that give the game a mix of challenge and strategy. Each player must
                  navigate between the three lanes and
                  send out a pair of three shapes to do battle against their foe. Both players have a choice of three
                  shapes: a sphere, a cube, or a triangular-prism with each shape able to defeat one of the others. The
                  goal of the game
                  is to get as many shapes as possible into your opponent's side within the time limit.</p>
                <p>Cadescent Aether was made during the 2017 Global Game Jam. I worked alongside 3
                  other programmers and took on the role of the game mechanics developer. I created and polished the
                  rock-paper-scissors mechanics and player controls. I also fine-tuned the rules and lane
                  movement mechanics. As well, I assisted my other team members with work on the menu screen UI and
                  with general debugging.</p>

                <p>Tuber Tyrants is a fun 4-player survival platformer with cartoon visuals and referential humour. Each
                  player controls a tuber, each representing a political leader, and try to jump on to the oncoming
                  platforms; the surviving tuber is declared the winner. However, the game will throw random challenges
                  known as "Alternate Facts" into the game to add difficulty for the players, inviting a more intense
                  and
                  exciting experience.</p>
                <p>Tuber Tyrants was made during the 2017 PTBO Game Jam. I worked on Tuber Tyrants
                  with 3 other programmers and an artist, I took the role of the mechanics developer, in which I created
                  the controls, platform movement, multiplayer functionality and the "Alternate Facts" mechanics; I also
                  assisted in general debugging.</p>

                <p>The Forgoatten Isles is a first-person platformer. Players must traverse through a series of
                  puzzles on three islands to find a key on each island, in order to unlock a grand door and acquire the
                  secret prize within. The player can run and jump on different cubes to reach the prize, however, some
                  cubes
                  behave differently and there are hidden traps all over the islands to add new levels of difficulty and
                  challenge to the game.</p>
                <p>The Forgoatten Isles was created during the 2017 ToJam. I worked on a 5-person team, 3 other
                  programmers and 1 artist. I was the mechanics developer, creating the mechanics for the different
                  blocks, the controls, and hidden traps. I also assisted in level editing and debugging</p>
