    <p>Tuber Tyrants is a fun 4 player survivial platform with cartoon visuals and referenctial humour. Each player
      controls a tuber, each repsresenting a political leader, and try to jump on to the on coming platforms; the
      surviving tuber is declared the winner. However the game will throw random challenges known as "Alternate Facts"
      to the game to add difficulty to players and inviting an more intense and exciting experience.</p>
    <p>Tuber Tyrants was made during the 2017 PTBO Game Jam from Feburary 21-23. I worked on Tuber Tyrants with 3 other
      programmers and a artist, I took the role as the mechanics developer, in which I created the controls, platform
      movement, multi-player and the Alternate Facts; I also assisted in debugging.</p>
