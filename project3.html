    <p>The Forgoatten Isles is a first-person platformer. Players must traverse through a series of
      puzzles on three islands to find a key on each island, in order to unlock a grand door and acquire the
      secret prize within. The player can run and jump on different cubes to reach the prize, however, some cubes
      behave differently and there are hidden traps all over the islands to add new levels of difficulty and
      challenge to the game.</p>
    <p>The Forgoatten Isles was created during the 2017 ToJam. I worked on a 5-person team, 3 other
      programmers and 1 artist. I was the mechanics developer, creating the mechanics for the different
      blocks, the controls, and hidden traps. I also assisted in level editing and debugging</p>
